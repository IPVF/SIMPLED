</p>
Output from the code: at each time the reasons for the decay to happen are compared and quantified one against the other.

## Inputs
The inputs are mainly the parameters of the layer, its bulk and interface recombination parameters as well as the duration of the pulsed laser.

1. Reason of the decay of PL integrated over the time of the simulation.
2. Percentages of total recombination as a function of recombination channel.
